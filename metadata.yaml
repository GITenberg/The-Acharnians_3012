description: It is the fifth century BC and Dikaiopolis, a peasant who is forced by
  war to live in the city, has secured an unlikely peace for Athens in their war against
  the Spartans. However, not all his fellow citizens agree with the new détente between
  themselves and their hated enemies. It is up to Dikaiopolis, in increasingly farcical
  circumstances, to defend his anti-war stance and save his precious peace. A timely
  and timeless comedy, Acharnians was first produced in 452BC during one of the sporadic
  and unreliable ceasefires in the Peloponnesian war between Athens and Sparta.
